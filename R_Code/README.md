# Calorie_Counter

The R code produces a simple dashboard for the data entered into the calorie counter application. Currently, a sample data set with 58 inputs (each representing one order/calculation) is used to showcase the different analyses.   

The following packages need to be installed to run the code:
  - install.packages(ggplot2)
  - install.packages(scales)
  - install.packages(dplyr)
  - install.packages(gridExtra)

Opening the plot in zoom mode enables better displaying of the results.
