# Calorie_Counter

The project Calorie_Counter is an application where the user can choose different products from a McDonalds menu. The main application will intake the data entered  and calculate the total calories picked. Additionally, there is an analysis provided for showing highlights of all data entered.

The application is consisting of three coding packages using three different languages. The data of a user get entered into the ruby part of the code. The visialization is done via HTML. The analysis afterwards is done via different graphics in R.  

Because of a missing database we did not connect the different parts of the code, but made them matching to each other, using the same variable etc. . We also provided a sample data set for showing the analytics for the R code.

The three different parts can be found in the following folders:
1. Ruby code (see folder "Ruby_Code")
2. HTML code (see folder "HTML_Code")
3. R code (see folder "R_Code")
